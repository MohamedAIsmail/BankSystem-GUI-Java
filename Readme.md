# Bank System
***

## Introduction

Created a bank system that can be used in most recent banks with an understandable UI
> As a **User** you can:
- Check personal information.
- Update your balance and withdraw from it.
- Deposit in your CreditCard accordingly to the balance added with a certain ratio.
- Transfer money to another account in the same bank.
- Purchase with CreditCard.
- Update personal information.

There is a new feature I'd like to mention.. There are two types of memberships VIP and Normal, It is determined according to the balance deposited in the account, If the balance exceeded a certain limit your membership will be updated.

> The difference between VIP account and Normal account is the following:
When a purchase is made there is a date taken at the time of purchase.. As a normal account you have 60 days to pay this amount back or else you will be indebted, As a VIP account you have 120 days to pay this amount back!
